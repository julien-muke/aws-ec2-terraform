## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

We are going to learn how to create an Amazon EC2 instance using Terraform. Terraform is a popular tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

1. Create an IAM User
2. Configure AWS profile and set up the AWS CLI
3. Create Terraform file (.tf) and write the Script
4. Execute the Terraform Script
5. Verify S3 Bucket is created 

## <a name="quick-start">ü§∏ Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create an IAM User, and the Access Key

First, we need to create a user and then create access keys for that particular user so that we can work with them for our authentication purpose.

1. Navigate to your AWS Console, search for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
2. Go the Tab at righ hand side and choose "Users"
3. Click "Create user"

4. Enter the "User name" i will use `ec2-terraform` then click "Next"

5. Set permissions, choose "Attached policies directly" search and choose `AmazonEC2FullAccess` then click "Next"

6. Review the details and click "Create user"

Now you can see that our user has been successfully created.

7. Next, let's create the access key for the user
8. Click on the user we just created

9. Scroll down to security crendentials tab, and click "Create access key"
10. Since I am going to work with command line interface, we will choose CLI and check the confirmation box and click "Next"

11. The access key is successfully created, now it will show the access key as well as the secret access key, I will simply go and download the CSV file.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Configure AWS profile and set up the AWS CLI

We are going to configure basic settings that the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) uses to interact with AWS. These include your security credentials, the default output format, and the default AWS Region.


1. Open VS Code (or any IDE of your choise) and run the command `aws configure`
2. Copy and paste your AWS Access Key ID
3. Copy and paste your AWS Secret Access key
4. Keep as default region name and output format

5. To check if the AWS profile is configured run the following command `aws configure list`
